  "precision": "Precision is the foundation of effective boxing. A perfectly placed shot with moderate power will always be more dangerous than a wild haymaker that misses. Focus on hitting the center of the target with technical accuracy to shatter your opponent's timing. True precision requires calm eyes; watch the target through the impact without blinking to ensure the kinetic chain completes exactly where intended.",
    "speed": "Speed is about relaxation and economy of motion. Keep your muscles loose until the point of impact to ensure your strikes travel along the shortest path. Fast hands are useless without the timing to place them correctly. Develop 'snap' by emphasizing the retraction; a hand that returns fast is a hand that can fire again instantly.",
    "latency": "Speed in the ring and in the system is about cutting waste. In boxing, we minimize telegraphing; in systems, we minimize overhead. True efficiency comes from doing only what is necessary at the highest possible velocity. Every millisecond saved in your reaction time is a mile of distance gained over your opponent.",
    "balanced": "To stay balanced, keep your feet shoulder-width apart and your weight centered. Avoid leaning too far forward or back, and always return to your base stance after every movement or punch. Focus on small, controlled steps rather than large lunges. A balanced fighter can defend or attack in any direction without a reset phase.",
    "double hook": "To block a double hook sequence starting at the body and moving to the head, pin your elbow to your hip for the first shot, then immediately slide your glove to your temple for the second. Maintain a slight crouch to reduce the target area. The transition must be fluid; don't wait to see the second hook, expect it as soon as the first one touches your guard.",
    "1-2": "To improve your 1-2, focus on the weight transfer from the front foot to the back foot during the transition from jab to cross. Ensure your hips rotate fully on the cross while keeping your chin tucked behind your lead shoulder for protection. The jab 'blinds' or 'measures', while the cross 'destroys'. Never pull the jab back halfway; use its full extension to mask the incoming power shot.",
    "spar": "Technical sparring is about learning, not winning. Start at 20% power, focus on your defensive shell and timing. Use your jab to measure distance and never trade shots without a clear strategic purpose. If you get hit, analyze why instead of getting angry. Anger ruins form, and form is your only protection.",
    "sparring": "Technical sparring is about learning, not winning. Start at 20% power, focus on your defensive shell and timing. Use your jab to measure distance and never trade shots without a clear strategic purpose. Work on your weaknesses during these rounds; if your footwork is slow, force yourself to stay mobile even if it feels awkward.",
    "stand": "Feet shoulder-width apart, chin down, hands high. Maintain a slight bend in the knees for mobility, weight centered to allow for instant movement in any direction. Your stance is your fortress; any crack in the foundation—like crossing your feet—makes the entire structure vulnerable to collapse.",
    "whip the jab": "Keep the arm relaxed like a wet rope. Tighten your fist only at the split-second of impact to snap the knuckles through the target. The elbow should remain down to ensure maximum velocity and to prevent the 'chicken-wing' tell that allows opponents to slip inside.",
    "short jab": "Snap it out like a whip. Keep your chin tucked and return it to your face immediately. Focus on the retraction speed, ensuring your hand returns to the defensive position faster than it left. A short jab isn't a weak jab; it's a deceptive tool used for finding range in tight quarters.",
    "long jab": "Step into it for range. Fully extend the arm, rotate the fist at impact, and use your lead shoulder to protect your chin while driving from the back foot. The long jab is a psychological weapon; it tells the opponent they are never safe, regardless of the distance.",

        "Olympic boxing emphasizes technical scoring and high-volume precision over raw power. Judges look for clean, forceful impacts that aren't smothered or partially blocked.",
        "The three-round format requires an immediate start. There is no time to 'feel out' an opponent; you must establish dominance in the first 30 seconds with a stiff jab and active footwork.",
        "Footwork in the amateurs is about 'hit and move'. Never stay in the same place for more than two punches. Use lateral exits to reset the center line and force the opponent to turn.",
        "Defensive responsibility is paramount. Even if you land a great shot, getting hit back cancels out your progress in the eyes of the judges. Always exit with your hands high.",
        "Conditioning for 3x3 minute rounds is specific; it's a sprint, not a marathon. Your high-intensity interval training should mimic the explosive bursts followed by short recoveries seen in elite competition."

        "To increase jab speed, focus on the 'pop' from the shoulder rather than the push from the arm. Keep the shoulder relaxed until the moment of extension.",
        "Don't over-rotate the fist too early. Keeping the thumb up until the last 10% of the punch minimizes air resistance and keeps the path narrow.",
        "Breathe out sharply with the punch. The contraction of the core provides the 'snap' that drives the hand forward like a piston.",
        "Practice the 'no-look' jab in shadowboxing—firing it from a neutral position without any preparatory movement or facial tension.",
        "Retraction is the key to a fast double jab. If the first jab doesn't return to the 'firing chamber' (near your face) instantly, the second jab will be slow and predictable."

If you've been rhythmically jabbing 1-2, pause for a half-beat or use a double-pump feint to reset their defensive timing.", "Positional Feints: Step slightly off-center to force the opponent to adjust their feet, then strike as they are mid-transition.", "Reaction Drawing: Feint a jab to see if they parry.

This draws their counter-fire prematurely, letting them punch air while they deplete their gas tank.", "Psychological volume control: Use a 'hand-flicker' feint to distract their vision.
